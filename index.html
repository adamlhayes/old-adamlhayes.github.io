        		<h1>Adam L. Hayes</h1>
				<p>I'm a PhD student at the University of Washington's Evans School of Public Policy and Governance focused primarily on topics related to environmental and natural resource economics and environmental policy and management.

I grew up in Colorado, and earned my B.A. from the University of Colorado in economics, political science, and international affairs. After graduating, I worked as a data specialist for Alpine Achievement Systems in Englewood, CO for six years, helping school districts in Colorado, New Mexico, and Wisconsin to interpret and effectively use their student achievement data. But, my primary interest has always been environmental policy. To pursue that interest, I earned a M.S. in energy economics from Colorado School of Mines in Golden while continuing to work.

I began my PhD studies in 2014 with support from the IGERT Program on Ocean Change here at UW and funded by the NSF. I couldn't be happier to be focused full-time on issues of environmental economics and policy. When I'm not working on my latest project, you can find me exploring Seattle or hiking with my wife Alex in the surrounding mountains or coasts.</p>
