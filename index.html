        		<h1>Adam L. Hayes</h1>
			<p>I'm a PhD student at the University of Washington's <a href="https://evans.uw.edu">
				Evans School of Public Policy and Governance</a> 
				focused primarily on topics related to environmental and natural resource economics and environmental policy 
				and management.</p>

<p>I grew up in Colorado, and earned my B.A. from the University of Colorado in economics, political science, and 
	international affairs. After graduating, I worked as a data specialist for 
	<a href="https://www.alpineachievement.com">Alpine Achievement Systems</a> 
	in Englewood, CO for six years, helping school districts in Colorado, New Mexico, and Wisconsin 
	to interpret and effectively use their student achievement data. But, my primary interest has always 
	been environmental policy. To pursue that interest, I earned a M.S. in energy economics 
	from the <a href="http://inside.mines.edu/Economics-Business-Home">Colorado School of Mines</a>
	in Golden while working at Alpine.</p>

<p>I began my PhD studies in 2014 with support from the <a href="http://depts.washington.edu/igertpoc/">IGERT Program on Ocean Change</a> 
	here at UW and funded by the NSF. I couldn't be happier to be focused full-time on issues of environmental 
	economics and policy. When I'm not working on my latest project, you can find me exploring Seattle or 
	hiking with my wife Alex in the surrounding mountains or coasts.</p>
